# **Iris dataset**

## **Iris dataset history**

Iris flower data, also known as Fisher's Iris dataset was introduced by British biologist and statistitian Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher. In 1936, Sir Fisher published a report titled [“The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x) in the journal Annals of Eugenics. In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. It was the first time that the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species as mentioned above appeared publicly.\

## **Iris dataset file**

This Iris dataset contains a set of 150 records which represent three iris species (*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor* and *Iris virginica*) with 50 samples each. 

The columns that represent records mentioned above are :

* Id
* SepalLengthCm
* SepalWidthCm
* PetalLengthCm
* PetalWidthCm
* Species


Iris dataset used in this analysis can be found among files in this repository as [Iris_dataset.csv](https://github.com/lgrealish/pands-project/blob/main/iris.csv).
